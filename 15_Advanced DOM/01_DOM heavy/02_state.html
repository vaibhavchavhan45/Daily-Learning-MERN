        /*
        When we have a state (an array of objects) in JS and want to show it on the page, the idea is simple: first, clear the parent container so old stuff disappears. Then, for each object in the state, create a <div> (or whatever element you want) and put the object’s info inside it — like title, description, maybe a button. Give it an id if you want to track it later. Finally, append it to the parent container. Whenever the state changes, just run this again: the parent is cleared, new elements are created, and the page always shows the current state. Basically, your HTML becomes a mirror of your state — whatever is in the state, that’s what you see on the page.

            one line summary is that ki whatever we get in state as input render it on webpage
            Doesnt mttr ki what previously present there, erase the prev things and render the contents of cuurent state


        why we r doing this thing?
        Why cant we put the data directly in HTML tag
        In real world websites you dont know ki whatever data is coming from the server and u have to render it on webpage 
        For that purpose we r doing this thing.
