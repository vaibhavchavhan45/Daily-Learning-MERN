<!-- It is just a same functionality we are trying to create which we did in prev file index.js using Document
here also we are doing the things in DOM but in react way
i.e. How under the hood react uses DOM -->

        //React mainly consist of state(those things on the website are dynamic means changes to the new value
        // Let say we click a button and its value changes to something else called state)
        // component(the things that we see on the webpage like icon, btn etc), 
        // and rendering of the components on the webpage(put on the webpage)
        //So, here using DOM how can we do that?
        //we have to create a simple btn whose value is "Counter 1" initially but the no. increments with 1 as we hit that btn
        //So here state is that number which changes as we hit the button
        //As we hit the btn what needs render on the screen "Counter 2" So, in react style we called it re rendering
        //Whoat needs to be re rendered?  The Counter String and the value from 1 to 2
        //For that we created a component is basically a btn with new value Counter 2
        //As the fn buttonComponentReRender() calls the createComponent() with new uppdated value of state 
        //re rendering of button happens
        // Make sure in re rendering clear everything from the parent div and re render it
        //Initially we re render a button with Counter 1 thatswhy we are calling buttonComponentReRender() globally

        // the only small tweak you could add for clarity:
        // React doesn’t clear the DOM entirely like you did with innerHTML = ""; it updates only the part that changed 
        // (via reconciliation and Virtual DOM).
        //But it is difficult to do it using DOM thatswhy we cleared the parent element completely and then
        //rendered the element(button) on the webpage
